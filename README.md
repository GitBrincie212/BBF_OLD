# Beyond Brainfuck / ABF

**Brainfuck** Was First Made By Urban MÃ¼ller With the Goal of Making a Small Compiler For AmigaOS. 
The Language Turned Out to Become Famous Even tho It Had a Very Difficult Syntax Closely Resembling to 
Binary Based On Difficulty and Was Meant to Be an Esoteric Programming Language (Not For Work).

This is a Almost Superset of Brainfuck, Most Code You Write In Beyond Brainfuck, Can Be Translated to
Brainfuck But For The Programs that Use The Custom Builtin Functions It Cannot Be Done.  

A BBF Ends in the Extension `.bbf` and for the Configuration File It is Called `BBF.config.json`,
You can also Run The Shell Command To Automatically Generate it For You Instead Of Having to Do Manually

> BBF Create **[FILE_NAME]**  {Coming Soon}

Great Now You can Start Programming In **BBF**. It's Best to Know That This is Mostly an Extension.
But It Has Rules To Follow, Here are All Rules that Must Be Followed

1. [ ] `Always Place a Semicolon ";" At the End Of Each Line`
2. [ ] `If Possible, Use Advanced Operators For Less Lines Of Code`
3. [ ] `For Lined Functions, Place Them First`


There are Plans For the Language Such As:

*Documentations Which Can Be Viewed Either By The HTML Files Or By Markdown Files, A Example Can Be How 
Lined Functions Work, The Advanced Operators And More*
